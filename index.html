            <h2>1. JavaScript Async</h2>
            <p>The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await
                keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be
                written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.</p>
            <pre><code>// Example of asynchronous behavior
                function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
                    return new Promise((resolve) => {
                      setTimeout(() => {
                        resolve('resolved');
                      }, 2000);
                    });
                  }
                  
                  async function asyncCall() {
                    console.log('calling');
                    const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
                    console.log(result);
                    // Expected output: "resolved"
                  }
                  
                  asyncCall();
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="callback">
            <h2>2. Callback</h2>
            <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked
                inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

                The consumer of a callback-based API writes a function that is passed into the API. The provider of the
                API (called the caller) takes the function and calls back (or executes) the function at some point
                inside the caller's body. The caller is responsible for passing the right parameters into the callback
                function. The caller may also expect a particular return value from the callback function, which is used
                to instruct further behavior of the caller.

                There are two ways in which the callback may be called: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous
                callbacks are called immediately after the invocation of the outer function, with no intervening
                asynchronous tasks, while asynchronous callbacks are called at some point later, after an asynchronous
                operation has completed.</p>
            <pre><code>// Example of a callback
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched");
        callback();
    }, 1000);
}

function logData() {
    console.log("Data logged");
}

fetchData(logData);

        <section id="promise">
            <h2>3. Promise</h2>
            <p>A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to
                associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets
                asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final
                value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.</p>
            <pre><code>// Example of a promise
let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 2000);
});

myPromise.then(result => console.log(result));
            </code></pre>

        <section id="async-await">
            <h2>4. Async/Await</h2>
            <p>async and await are modern JavaScript keywords that make it easier to work with Promises and handle
                asynchronous operations in a cleaner, more readable way. They were introduced in ES2017 and have become
                widely used for dealing with asynchronous code.</p>
            <h3>async Keyword</h3>
            <p>The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. A function declared with async always
                returns a Promise. If the function returns a value, JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved
                Promise. If an error is thrown, it will be returned as a rejected Promise.</p>
            <pre><code>// Example of async//
                async function hello() {
                    return "Hello World!";
                }
                  hello().then(console.log);  // Output: "Hello World!"
            </code></pre>

            <h3>await Keyword</h3>
            <p>The await keyword is used inside an async function and pauses the execution of the function until the
                Promise is resolved or rejected. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making
                it easier to read and understand.</p>
            <pre><code>// Example of await//
                async function fetchData() {
                    let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
                    let data = await response.json();
                    console.log(data);
                }
                fetchData();
            </code></pre>

        <section id="eventLoop">
            <h2>5. Event Loop</h2>
            The Event Loop is one of the most crucial concepts in JavaScript. It allows JavaScript to handle
            asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, Promises, or I/O tasks) while remaining single-threaded, meaning
            it can perform non blocking tasks without freezing or slowing down the program.

            Here's a breakdown of how the Event Loop works:

            <h3>JavaScript's Single-Threaded Nature</h3>
            JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. However, JavaScript
            can manage multiple tasks (like network requests, timers, etc.) through the Event Loop by pushing tasks to
            different queues and executing them when the main thread is free.
            <pre><code>// Example of Event Loop
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => console.log('This is executed last'), 0);

console.log('End');
            </code></pre>
